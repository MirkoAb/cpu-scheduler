# CPU Scheduling Simulator — FCFS (C Project)

This is a simple Operating System scheduling simulator written in **pure C**.

The project implements **only one algorithm**:
## 1️⃣ FCFS — First Come First Served
The simplest CPU scheduling method where processes are executed in the order they arrive.

## ▶️ How to Compile and Run

```bash
# Linux / macOS
gcc cpu_scheduler.c -o cpu_scheduler
./cpu_scheduler

# Windows (MinGW)
gcc cpu_scheduler.c -o cpu_scheduler.exe
cpu_scheduler.exe
```

## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project demonstrates:
- How FCFS scheduling works  
- How processes wait in a queue  
- How waiting time and turnaround time are calculated  

This is a minimal and easy-to-understand OS simulation project.
